# DQL (Docent Query Language) Reference

Docent Query Language is a read-only SQL subset that supports ad-hoc exploration in Docent.

Queries can only run over a single collection by design.

## Executing DQL

Choose the right method based on context:

* **`execute_dql` MCP tool** — Use for ad-hoc exploration and orientation (Step 1). Runs DQL directly without requiring user approval of inline scripts. Preferred for all exploratory queries.
* **`client.query()`** — Use inside analysis plan scripts. Query and results table appear in Docent UI. Use this for DQL that feeds data into readings, or that you want the user to see alongside reading results. Pass `name="..."` to give the step a display name.
* **`client.execute_dql()`** — Use inside Python scripts for internal logic (e.g., conditional logic between reading steps, or data that feeds into scripted readings). Results are NOT shown in the Docent UI.

```python
from docent.sdk.client import Docent

client = Docent()
collection_id = "<collection-uuid>"

# (Optional) inspect available tables/columns
schema = client.get_dql_schema(collection_id)

# In analysis plan scripts: query as a UI-visible step
rows = client.query(
    collection_id,
    "SELECT agent_runs.id AS agent_run_id FROM agent_runs LIMIT 10",
    name="Recent runs",
)

# Inside scripts for internal logic: results not shown in UI
result = client.execute_dql(
    collection_id,
    "SELECT agent_runs.id AS agent_run_id FROM agent_runs LIMIT 10",
)
raw_rows = client.dql_result_to_dicts(result)
```

**`arguments_dict` structure**

For template readings, keys are param names (matching template slot names); values are typed context item objects:

| Type | Fields |
| --- | --- |
| `"transcript"` | `id`, `agent_run_id`, `collection_id` |
| `"transcript_slice"` | `transcript_id`, `start_idx`, `end_idx`, `agent_run_id`, `collection_id` |
| `"agent_run"` | `id`, `collection_id` |
| `"reading_result"` | `id`, `collection_id` |

Each value may also be a list of the above objects if the param accepts multiple items.

For scripted readings, `arguments_dict` holds arbitrary user-supplied metadata passed in per-request; it is included in the cache key but not used to resolve template parameters.

### `reading_result_links`

| Column | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `reading_id` | FK to readings.id. |
| `result_id` | FK to reading_results.id. |

## JSON Metadata Access Patterns

Docent stores user-supplied metadata as JSON. Access using Postgres operators:

```sql
-- Filter agent runs by a metadata attribute
SELECT id, name
FROM agent_runs
WHERE metadata_json->>'environment' = 'staging';
```

```sql
-- Retrieve nested transcript metadata
-- Dots in `get_metadata_fields` output (e.g. `metadata.conversation.speaker`) indicate nested JSON objects;
-- traverse with -> for intermediate keys and ->> for the final key.
SELECT
  id,
  metadata_json->'conversation'->>'speaker' AS speaker,
  metadata_json->'conversation'->>'topic' AS topic
FROM transcripts
WHERE metadata_json->>'status' = 'flagged';
```

```sql
-- Cast numeric metadata for aggregation
SELECT
  AVG(CAST(metadata_json->>'latency_ms' AS DOUBLE PRECISION)) AS avg_latency_ms
FROM agent_runs
WHERE metadata_json ? 'latency_ms';
```

When querying JSON fields, comparisons default to string semantics. Cast values when you need numeric ordering or aggregation.

## Example Queries

### Recent Runs

```sql
SELECT
  id,
  name,
  metadata_json->'model'->>'name' AS model_name,
  created_at
FROM agent_runs
WHERE metadata_json->>'status' = 'completed'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Transcript Counts per Group

```sql
SELECT
  tg.id AS group_id,
  tg.name AS group_name,
  COUNT(t.id) AS transcript_count
FROM transcript_groups tg
JOIN transcripts t ON t.transcript_group_id = tg.id
GROUP BY tg.id, tg.name
HAVING COUNT(t.id) > 1
ORDER BY transcript_count DESC;
```

### Completion Rate by Environment (CTE pattern)

```sql
WITH normalized_runs AS (
  SELECT
    metadata_json->>'environment' AS environment,
    metadata_json->>'status' AS status
  FROM agent_runs
  WHERE metadata_json ? 'environment'
)
SELECT
  environment,
  COUNT(environment) AS total_runs,
  SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'completed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS completed_runs,
  ROUND(CAST(
    CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'completed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS DOUBLE PRECISION)
    / NULLIF(COUNT(environment), 0)
  AS NUMERIC), 3) AS completion_rate
FROM normalized_runs
GROUP BY environment
ORDER BY total_runs DESC;
```


### Reading Results for a Specific Reading

```sql
SELECT
  rr.id AS result_id,
  rrl.reading_id,
  rr.output,
  rr.error,
  rr.arguments_dict
FROM reading_results rr
JOIN reading_result_links rrl ON rrl.result_id = rr.id
WHERE rrl.reading_id = '<reading-uuid>'
ORDER BY rr.id DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

## Restrictions and Best Practices

- **Read-only**: Only `SELECT`-style queries are permitted.
- **Single statement**: Batches or multiple statements are rejected.
- **Explicit projection**: Wildcard projections (`*`) are disallowed. List the columns you need.
- **Collection scoping**: A single query can only access data within a single collection.
- **Limit enforcement**: Every query is capped at 10,000 rows. Use pagination (`OFFSET`/`LIMIT`) for larger row collections.
- **JSON performance**: Heavy JSON traversal across large collections can be slow. Prefer top-level fields when available.
- **Type awareness**: Cast values explicitly when precision matters.

## DQL quirks

### No Wildcards Allowed
- `SELECT *` is forbidden
- `COUNT(*)` is forbidden - use `COUNT(column_name)` instead

### No DISTINCT ON
`DISTINCT ON (column)` is not supported in DQL (it uses tuple expressions, which are forbidden). Use `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY ... ORDER BY ...)` with a `WHERE rn = 1` filter instead:
```sql
-- Wrong: SELECT DISTINCT ON (task) id, task FROM agent_runs ORDER BY task, id
-- Right:
SELECT id, task FROM (
    SELECT ar.id AS id, ar.metadata_json->>'task' AS task,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY ar.metadata_json->>'task' ORDER BY ar.id) AS rn
    FROM agent_runs ar
) AS subq
WHERE rn = 1
```

### GROUP BY: Always Use the Subquery Pattern
Aliases, CASE expressions, and COALESCE don't work directly in GROUP BY when selecting from `agent_runs`. **Use the subquery pattern by default for ALL queries that GROUP BY derived columns** — it is never wrong and avoids the most common class of DQL errors:

```sql
SELECT task, model_name, COUNT(task) AS run_count
FROM (
    SELECT
        metadata_json->>'task' AS task,
        metadata_json->'agent'->>'model_name' AS model_name
    FROM agent_runs
    WHERE ...
) AS subq
GROUP BY task, model_name
```

**Common pitfall: only GROUP BY the dimensions, not the aggregated columns.** When the outer SELECT has both grouping columns and aggregations (COUNT, AVG, etc.), only the grouping columns go in GROUP BY. Putting aggregated columns in GROUP BY turns each row into its own group and defeats the aggregation:

```sql
-- Wrong: includes aggregated columns in GROUP BY
SELECT task, COUNT(task) AS run_count, ROUND(CAST(AVG(score) AS NUMERIC), 3) AS avg_score
FROM (...) AS subq
GROUP BY task, run_count, avg_score

-- Right: only the dimension column
SELECT task, COUNT(task) AS run_count, ROUND(CAST(AVG(score) AS NUMERIC), 3) AS avg_score
FROM (...) AS subq
GROUP BY task
```

### Avoid Dynamic IN Clauses with String Interpolation
Building IN clauses with f-strings is dangerous:
- Task names containing `::` can be parsed as PostgreSQL type casts
- Instead: use a subquery or CTE to derive the filter set in DQL, or as a last resort, fetch all relevant data and filter in Python

```sql
-- Dangerous: task_name::v2 gets parsed as a type cast
-- WHERE task IN ('task_name::v2', 'other_task::v3')

-- Safe: derive the filter set from a CTE or subquery
WITH target_tasks AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT task FROM (
        SELECT metadata_json->>'task' AS task FROM agent_runs
    ) AS subq
    WHERE task LIKE '%retry%'
)
SELECT ar.id FROM agent_runs ar
JOIN target_tasks tt ON ar.metadata_json->>'task' = tt.task
```

### ROUND Requires NUMERIC Cast
`ROUND(double_precision, integer)` does not exist in DQL. Cast to NUMERIC first:
```sql
-- Wrong: ROUND(AVG(...), 3)
-- Right:
ROUND(CAST(AVG(...) AS NUMERIC), 3)
```

### JSON Access Patterns
- Nested: `metadata_json->'parent'->>'child'`
- Flat key with dot: `metadata_json->>'parent.child'`
- Check key existence: `metadata_json ? 'key'`
