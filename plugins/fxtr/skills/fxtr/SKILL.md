name: fxtr
description: Set up, write, run, and view fxtr experiments, including new projects (`fxtr new`), steps and workflows, sweeps over models, prompts, or datasets, reductions, querying arrays (filter, aggregate, join, SQL), input datasets, reports, launching and resuming jobs, cached step results and reruns, and viewer renderers, results overviews, and the charts and visualizations in them. Use whenever starting or working in a fxtr project, creating or changing an experiment, or when a run reused results it should have recomputed (or recomputed results it should have reused).

# fxtr

fxtr runs experiments as durable, inspectable DAGs. An experiment is Python code in a fxtr
project: steps do the computation, and workflows schedule steps over arrays with named
dimensions. A launch runs a workflow as a job on the project's Postgres database, which caches
every step's result, and the experiment viewer shows the job's DAG and data through the
project's renderers.

The pages below are fxtr's documentation, grouped by the part of the work they cover. Read the
ones a task needs before writing code. [Core concepts](references/concepts/overview.mdx)
shows how the parts fit together, and its
[glossary](references/concepts/overview.mdx#glossary) defines the terms the pages use.

## Best practices

Do these by default, unless the user asks otherwise.

### Writing experiments

* **Name every step and workflow.** Pass `name=` to each `@step` and `@workflow`. The step cache,
  resumed jobs, and the viewer's renderers find a function by its
  [registered name](references/concepts/workflows-and-steps.mdx#registered-names), and the
  default name, taken from the function's module, changes when the function moves.
* **Write each docstring's first sentence for the viewer.** The operation's card shows it, so make
  it a short imperative sentence saying what the operation does
  ([Watch jobs in the viewer](references/guides/running-and-viewing-jobs.mdx#watch-jobs-in-the-viewer)).
* **Return a report from the root workflow**: one entity that references every result worth
  presenting, for the launcher and the results overview to read
  ([Read results](references/guides/running-and-viewing-jobs.mdx#read-results)).
* **Keep the graph's edges.** If an unavoidable reconstruction loses an edge in the viewer (an
  array observed, transformed in Python, and added back as a source), tell the user.
* **Keep stale results out of a changed step.** The cache matches a step by its name and inputs,
  not its code. After changing what a step computes, handle the change as
  [Handling changes to step logic](references/concepts/managing-the-step-cache.mdx#handling-changes-to-step-logic)
  describes before relaunching, and tell the user which results the next launch recomputes.

### Visualizing experiments

Write renderers in the project's renderer package, `views/`. If the project has none, ask the user
before [adding one](references/reference/renderers.mdx#adding-a-package-to-a-project).

* **Give every entity type you introduce its renderers**, registered under its type tag: an
  `EntityPanel` that leads with what matters in the entity, and an `EntityInlineLink` that names
  it in a few words, since the default link shows only its type and a short ID. For a type with
  many fields, add an `EntityHoverPreview` showing the few that identify it. Records from
  behaviors already have renderers; the [behaviors skill](../behaviors/SKILL.md) says how to
  include them.
* **Give every step you write an `InvocationPanel`**, registered under the step's name. It
  becomes the step's default view, in its pane and in its card's preview, and it is handed every
  invocation the viewer's selection picks out, up to all of a mapped step's. Show one in full and
  several together (a table with a row per key, a chart, or a summary), loading their outputs
  with `LoadEach` ([Step panels](references/reference/renderers.mdx#step-panels)).
  Wrapping a view of one invocation in `singleInvocation` asks the reader to select one when
  there are several, so keep it for the root workflow and for steps that are neither mapped nor
  replicated.
* **Give the root workflow a results overview**: an `InvocationPanel` that reads the workflow's
  report and presents the experiment's findings
  ([Results overviews](references/concepts/visualization-and-custom-renderers.mdx#results-overviews)).
* **Check a view without opening it.** After changing a view, confirm it builds and run the
  searches in [Check it](references/guides/designing-views.mdx#check-it), then tell the
  user it is ready to look at in their viewer. Don't open the viewer in a browser yourself, or set
  up Playwright or a headless browser to screenshot it, unless the user asks you to.

### Running jobs

* **Start the viewer before a launch.** When the user asks for a job to run, first start
  `uv run fxtr view` in the background, as a long-running process of its own that you don't wait
  on. When the project's viewer already runs, this only opens it, so it is safe every time. Each
  launch then opens its job in a new tab of the viewer: tell the user it is there, and report the
  job's ID and status from the launch's output. A launch that finds no viewer prints
  `no viewer is running for this project` with the command to start one: start it then.
* **Keep the viewer running** across launches and renderer edits. It rebuilds the renderers when
  their sources change, and the open viewer switches to them in place, so never ask the user to
  reload or restart it.

### Reading the documentation

* **Know which documentation you have.** Distributed in the fxtr plugin for Claude Code or
  Codex, this skill carries a copy of the pages, and `provenance.json` beside this file records
  the fxtr and behaviors versions they describe. If the project depends on another fxtr version
  (its `uv.lock` says which), tell the user. The plugin has its own version and update cycle; docs.transluce.ai has
  the newest pages.
